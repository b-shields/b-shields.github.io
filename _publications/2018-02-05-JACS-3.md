excerpt: This paper summarizes a synthetic, computational, and ultrafast spectroscopyic study of Ni(II) complexes common to cross-coupling and Ni/photoredox reactions. Computational and ultrafast spectroscopic studies reveal that these complexes feature long-lived excited states, implicating Ni as an underexplored alternative to precious metal photocatalysts.

Here we investigate the photophysics and photochemistry of Ni(II) aryl halide complexes common to cross-coupling and Ni/photoredox reactions. Computational and ultrafast spectroscopic studies reveal that these complexes feature long-lived excited states, implicating Ni as an underexplored alternative to precious metal photocatalysts. Moreover, we show that 3MLCT Ni(II) engages in bimolecular electron transfer with ground-state Ni(II), which enables access to Ni(III) in the absence of external oxidants or photoredox catalysts. As such, it is possible to facilitate Ni-catalyzed C–O bond formation solely by visible light irradiation, thus representing an alternative strategy for catalyst activation in Ni cross-coupling reactions.
