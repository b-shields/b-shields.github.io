We report a redox‐neutral formylation of aryl chlorides that proceeds through selective 2‐functionalization of 1,3‐dioxolane through nickel and photoredox catalysis. This scalable benchtop approach provides a distinct advantage over traditional reductive carbonylation in that no carbon monoxide, pressurized gas, or stoichiometric reductant is employed. The mild conditions give unprecedented scope from abundant and complex aryl chloride starting materials.
