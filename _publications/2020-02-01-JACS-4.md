excerpt: Building on our previous work, we spectroscopically investigate the long-lived state's of Ni(II) aryl halide complexes. Ultrafast UV-Vis and mid-IR transient absorption data suggest that a MLCT state is generated initially upon excitation, but decays to a long-lived state that is <sup>3</sup>d-d in character.

Previous work from two of our groups studied the photophysics of Ni(t-Bubpy)(o-Tol)Cl, which is representative of proposed intermediates in many Ni-photoredox reactions. This complex was found to have a long-lived excited state (τ = 4 ns), which was computationally assigned as a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) state with an energy of 1.6 eV (38 kcal/mol). This work evaluates the computational assignment experimentally. Ultrafast UV-Vis and mid-IR transient absorption data suggest that a MLCT state is generated initially upon excitation, but decays to a long-lived state that is 3d-d rather than 3MLCT in character. Dynamic cis,trans-isomerization was observed in the dark using 1H NMR techniques, supporting that this 3d-d state is tetrahedral and accessible at ambient temperature. Through a combination of transient absorption and NMR studies, the 3d-d energy was determined to be ~0.5 eV (11 kcal/mol) above the ground state.
