I was born and raised in Asheville, North Carolina. In 2014, I graduated from the University of North Carolina Asheville with degrees in chemistry and applied mathematics. As an undergraduate, I conducted research in the group of Dr. Herman Holt, where I first got a taste for synthetic organic chemistry preparing heterocyclic analogues of microtubule interfering agents.

After my undergraduate studies, I was accepted to the chemistry graduate program at Princeton University and ultimately joined the research group of Abigail G. Doyle. As a member of the Doyle lab, I received training in synthetic methods development and catalysis.
