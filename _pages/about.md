I am a scientist with a background in synthetic chemistry, photophysics, quantum mechanical modeling, machine learning, and software development. My interdisciplinary experience was forged from a problem-oriented approach to science. As they say, when someoneâ€™s only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When I need to drive a screw, I go find a drill. Accordingly, on a single research project I may go from simulating light-matter interactions on a HPC cluster, to experimenting with reactive materials in the lab, to engineering laser experiments with an international team at a particle accelerator.

Whether in the lab or on my computer I love breaking down challenging problems, developing useful applications of new technology, and understanding the underlying mechanisms driving complex systems. 

Areas of Expertise
======
### Machine Learning for Chemical Synthesis
My research in this area seeks to realize hybrid chemical-ML approaches to synthetic chemistry. Subjects of current interest include: synergistic reaction design and discovery, Bayesian optimization of chemical reactions, interpreting hybrid physical-ML models, and translation of knowledge between applications via transfer learning.

### Organometallic Photophysics & Spectroscopy
Transition metal complexes play critical roles as photocatalysts for solar-to-electrical energy conversion and chemical synthesis. My research in this area utilizes organometallic chemistry, quantum mechanical modeling, and ultrafast spectroscopy to understand and improve photocatalytic systems.

### Synthetic Photochemistry & Methods Development
Photochemistry utilizes energy in the form of light to drive unique and otherwise unfavorable chemical reactions. The objective of this work is to develop broadly useful photosynthetic methods for small molecule synthesis.
